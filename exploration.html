  <p>cThese are the ideas and the board game pieces. Our board game involved around warfare. Here is the steps:
  At beginning of game: Each player starts at one corner of the board; pieces of artillery placed randomly.
Does not matter where you go; you just try to have your colored artillery on the board. During the Game: Roll the die.
Pick whichever way you want to go. Whether you land on a square or star, you do something. Objective of Game: 
Be the last person standing; (your artillery is last to leave).

  <p>This is my character for the original clicking game. In the game you try to click on the character, in this case the 
    image of the water-droplet like thingie above.</p>
